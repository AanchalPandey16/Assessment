Analysis Steps

Setup & Import: Created PostgreSQL tables for ads_daily, product_master, and sales_daily. Imported CSVs and validated row counts and date ranges.

Ads Aggregation: Aggregated ads_daily by product, platform, and date to calculate total ad_spend, clicks, and impressions → ads_daily_agg.

Final Table: Left-joined sales_daily with ads_daily_agg and product_master → final_data. Filled missing ad metrics with 0 for completeness.

Derived Metrics: Computed ROAS, CTR, and average selling price at the category level → category_metrics.

Missing Data Check: Identified 35.68% of rows missing category information, contributing 32.63% of total revenue.

Export: Saved final_data and category_metrics as CSVs for downstream analysis and reporting.

Summary

Consolidated sales, ads, and product data into a single, clean dataset for analysis.

Generated category-level efficiency metrics to evaluate performance effectively.

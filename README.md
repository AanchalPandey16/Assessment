3. Check revenue outlier days to understand spikes or drops caused by promotions, events, or errors
4. Optimize product mix by bundling or cross-promoting underperforming products with top performers
5. Monitor daily volatility to track category-level daily revenue and ROAS and spot anomalies quickly
